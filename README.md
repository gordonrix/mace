# Maple: Mutation Analysis for Parallel Evolution

Maple is a snakemake-based workflow for analysis of mutation-rich next generation sequencing data
from highly parallelized experiments, with a special focus on Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) data.
It provides consensus sequence generation using unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), easy-to-use and 
versatile demultiplexing, and a suite of analyses and plots.
